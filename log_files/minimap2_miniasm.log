START METHODS PRINTING
description: Minimap2 is a fast all-vs-all mapper of reads that relies on sketches of sequences, composed of minimizers. Miniasm uses the found overlaps to construct an assembly graph. As a consensus step is lacking in this pipeline, post-assembly polishing is often required.

END METHODS PRINTING
[M::main] ===> Step 1: reading read mappings <===
[M::ma_hit_read::0.070*0.57] read 12241 hits; stored 17386 hits and 895 sequences (34431186 bp)
[M::main] ===> Step 2: 1-pass (crude) read selection <===
[M::ma_hit_sub::0.073*0.60] 877 query sequences remain after sub
[M::ma_hit_cut::0.073*0.60] 13556 hits remain after cut
[M::ma_hit_flt::0.074*0.60] 11160 hits remain after filtering; crude coverage after filtering: 9.67
[M::main] ===> Step 3: 2-pass (fine) read selection <===
[M::ma_hit_sub::0.075*0.64] 850 query sequences remain after sub
[M::ma_hit_cut::0.075*0.64] 10770 hits remain after cut
